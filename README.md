# Counter-App-01 🚀

This is a simple **React.js Counter App** created using React's built-in `useState` hook. It allows users to increment or decrement a counter value by clicking buttons. This is my very first React project, and it's built purely with functional components and state management using React.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔼 Increment the counter
- 🔽 Decrement the counter
- ⚛️ Built using React.js and React State
